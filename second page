The car was coming down the street
All you hear is a crowd starting to roar
The car slows down and the doors opens slowly
A driver gets out the car with a mask on taking in the crowd 
The crowd starts to gather around his car
He gazes across the crowd looking everybody down
He stands on top of car streching out his neck and doing a quick neck roll
He starts to tap his foot to a beat
The car radio starts to playing music 
The singer taps the mic and clears his throat
The crowd starts to stomp to the beat
He starts to sing on top of the car
The crowd goes crazy and the last thing I heard looking out of my window was...
The Roar
